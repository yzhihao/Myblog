# 《Deep Learning》-Deep Feedforward Networks

**from now on,I will write my blog of the book(deep learning)  in English,I am sorry that my English is so poor,but ,i will try my best**


##  Feedforward neural networks

* Feedforward neural networks are called networks because they are typically represented by composing together many different functions.
* these networks are called neural because they are loosely inspired by neuroscience.
* There are no feedback connections in which outputs of the model are fed back into itself. When feedforward neural networks are extended to include feedback connections, they are called recurrent neural networks
* It is best to think of feedforward networks as function approximation machines that are designed to achieve statistical generalization, occasionally drawing some insights from what we know about the brain, rather than as models of brain function


## linear models and nonlinear functions

To extend linear models to represent nonlinear functions of x, we can apply the linear model not to x itself but to a transformed input φ(x), where φ is a nonlinear transformation. Equivalently, we can apply the kernel trick described in Sec. 5.7.2 , to obtain a nonlinear learning algorithm based on implicitly applying the φ mapping. We can think of φ as providing a set of features describing x, or as providing a new representation for x .

## how to choose the mapping φ(kernel)

1. One option is to use a very generic φ, such as the infinite-dimensional φ that is implicitly used by kernel machines based on the RBF kernel. If φ(x) is of high enough dimension, we can always have **enough capacity to fit the training set(advantage)**, but **generalization to the test set often remains poor(disadvange,by overfitting)**. Very generic feature mappings are usually based only on the principle of local smoothness and do not encode enough prior information to solve advanced problems.
2. Another option is to manually engineer φ . Until the advent of deep learning, this was the dominant approach. This approach requires decades of human effort for each separate task, with practitioners specializing in different domains such as speech recognition or computer vision, and with little transfer between domains.

## Cost Functions

mean squared error and mean absolute error often lead to poor results when used with gradient-based optimization. Some output units that saturate produce very small gradients when combined with these cost functions. This is one reason that the cross-entropy cost function is more popular than mean squared error or mean absolute error, even when it is not necessary to estimate an entire distribution p( y | x ) .

## Regularization

Regularization of an estimator works by trading increased bias for reduced variance.


### why we do not need to leaves the biases regularized

Before delving into the regularization behavior of different norms, we note that for neural networks, we typically choose to use a parameter norm penalty Ω that penalizes only the weights of the affine transformation at each layer and leaves the biases unregularized. The biases typically require less data to fit accurately than the weights. **Each weight specifies how two variables interact. Fitting the weight well requires observing both variables in a variety of conditions. Each bias controls only a single variable. This means that we do not induce too much variance by leaving the biases unregularized. Also, regularizing the bias parameters can introduce a significant amount of underfitting.** We therefore use the vector **w** to indicate all of the weights that should be affected by a norm penalty, while the vector **θ** denotes all of the parameters, including both w and the unregularized parameters.

## the sigmoid function use as output units

Their use as output units is compatible with the use of gradient-based learning when an appropriate cost function can undo the saturation of the sigmoid in the output layer.

## Architecture Design

In these chain-based architectures, the main architectural considerations are to choose the depth of the network and the width of each layer. As we will see,a network with even one hidden layer is sufficient to fit the training set. Deeper networks often are able to use far fewer units per layer and far fewer parameters and often generalize to the test set, but are also often harder to optimize. The ideal network architecture for a task must be found via experimentation guided by monitoring the validation set error.

### Multi-Task Learning

Multi-task learning ( Caruana , 1993 ) is a way to improve generalization by pooling the examples (which can be seen as soft constraints imposed on the parameters) arising out of several tasks. In the same way that additional training examples put more pressure on the parameters of the model towards values that generaliz well, when part of a model is shared across tasks, that part of the model is more constrained towards good values (assuming the sharing is justified), often yielding better generalization.

### linear model

A linear model, mapping from features to outputs via matrix multiplication, canby definition represent only linear functions. It has the advantage of being easy to train because many loss functions result in convex optimization problems when applied to linear models. Unfortunately, we often want to learn nonlinear functions.

## deeper is better

a feedforward network with a single layer is sufficient to represent any function, but the layer may be infeasibly large and may fail to learn and generalize correctly. In many circumstances, using deeper models can reduce the number of units required to represent the desired function and can reduce the amount of generalization error
